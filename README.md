# Vulnerability Notifier

Vulnerability Notifier is service that notifies website owners when vulnerabilities found for any of technologies used in their website.

Used services:
  - [Builtwith Api](http://api.builtwith.com/)
  - [CVE Details Widget](http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-feeds-form.php)

This will extract used technologies of a website by Builtwith api and vulnerabilities by CveDetails widget. When new vulnerability if found for a technology, it will send an email to website owner.

### Installation
Update `config.php` and change Builtwith api token and database information, then import `database.sql` to your database. it will create mysql tables.  
After that there is a `job.php` file that should be called regularely (daily for example), so a cronjob or scheduled tasked should run it. (In demo, you should call it by your browser)

### Demo
This code has been deployed to an Openshift host available at this address:  
[http://notifier-masihyeganeh.rhcloud.com](http://notifier-masihyeganeh.rhcloud.com)  
Unfortunately it does not support cronjob, so after saving a website you should manually load this address:  
[http://notifier-masihyeganeh.rhcloud.com/job.php](http://notifier-masihyeganeh.rhcloud.com/job.php)  
It won't sent emails too, but it will show you what it will send.

### How it works
First you enter your website url. you have two options here:
- [Exact Domain] If checked, it won't check technologies used in subdomains of entered url
- [Include Sub Pages] If checked, it will also check technologies used in sub pages of entered url

After clicking "Check" button, it will try to suggest an owner email related to the entered url (extracted by Builtwith api) or let user enter his email. after clicking on "Save" button, it will extract used technologies and optimally relates them to this address.  
Whenever `job.php` is executed, it will fetch last vulnerabilities from CveDetails and chech technologies name in it. If any of them is matched, it will send an email to the saved email address of any url this technology is used in with site's url, technology name and vulnerability details url.
